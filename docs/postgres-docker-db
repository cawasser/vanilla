'docker pull postgres'
This pulls the official postgres docker image from the repo. Once you have the image
on your machine you don't have to run this again. To check if you already have
this image, use 'docker images' and check if postgres is listed.


Once you have the postgres image, run the following command:
'docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=Password -p 5432:5432 -d postgres'
This will create a container running postgres at port 5432.
