# Using the REPL to Develop on the Server

REPL-driven develop is one of Clojure's ["superpowers"](#repl-driven-development-resources)
and Vanilla should take advantage of this as much as possible, and we
want this to work *without restarting the server*.

## Starting the REPL

The server startup procedure:

    lein run

opens an nREPL at port 7000. Simply configure your ID to connect to this nREPL and open
the connection. Now you can start evaluating server code directly from your IDE!
