# Running the Code in 'Development Mode' 

- Start server: `lein run`
- Start shadow-cljs: `shadow-cljs watch app`
- Go to http://localhost:5000



#### Note:
If this is the first time you run the application, you will have to run
```npm install``` before the above commands. If you do not you will be 
prompted to do so anyway.
